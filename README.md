Assessment Task
This assessment aims to evaluate the group's ability to apply project management methodology to evaluate and enhance the capstone project developed in semester one. The group should be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the capstone project from semester one and make improvements based on additional knowledge. Additionally, machine learning results should improve based on understanding the dataset, which machine learning models are best used, and why. Improving the model’s performance with hyper-tuning parameters with an understanding of the performance metrics and dataset. Finally, validate the results and report on your findings. 
The final report should build on from semester one and include your findings of machine learning implementation, results validation, model comparison, and any future recommendations. The report should be presented in a clear and concise manner, and it should demonstrate the group's ability to work collaboratively using a project management methodology.
The presentation should present your findings in a clear way for stakeholders.

You are now required to present your findings and initial results with the aid of 4 elements: a presentation, report paper, artefact, and individual reflective report.

You will create a maximum 5-minute presentation where you will include the following items. Remember that this is a guideline. You can include other items not mentioned below or remove items irrelevant to your project as long as you are within the allocated 5 minutes. 

Introduction.
Business description.
Hypothesis.
General goal.
Success criteria/indicators.
Technologies used.
Models
Libraries
Machine Learning Algorithm (at least 3 used and compared is required).
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation (required).
etc...
What has been accomplished so far?
Data: datasets, source, attributes, dimensions, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, data preparation (required).
Models.
Challenges encountered.
Including strategies used to overcome them.
Results and analysis… next steps.
Conclusion.
** Note that there is NO code on slides, and every team member must present in the presentation.

You will also have to finalise the group report that includes the following: 
All the elements that apply from the presentation described above.
Citations and references where necessary (i.e., where you make claims or statements about technology and its performance).
Professional structure, clear, easy to follow, with coherent flow between sections.

Students are advised to review and adhere to the submission requirements documented after the assessment task. 

Individual Reflective Report: 
Regarding the individual reflective report, what were your contributions to all aspects of the project, from selecting the dataset to the final presentation and report? Finally, what was your contribution to the creation of a PowerPoint presentation and report? 
In terms of team dynamics, how did you work well within the team and were able to leverage each other's strengths to deliver a high-quality project? How did you contribute to the communication and were able to communicate effectively, share ideas and provide constructive feedback to improve the quality of the group work? However, if there were some challenges in coordinating schedules and balancing workload, how were you flexible and adapting to changing circumstances? 
In terms of the learning journey, how did this project help you develop a deeper understanding of data analytics / AI?  
Overall, how did this project help you develop valuable technical and collaboration skills that can be applied in future projects? 
Minimum of 750 words.


Order of presentations will be decided by your lecturer.

WORD COUNT: 7,000 words. If your report is too short or long, you may lose up to 10% of marks!

If you go over the allotted time, you may lose up to 10% of marks.
